I am Ma Donna Sadio, a third-year student striving for a B.B.A. in Management Information Systems at the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa. 

After the COVID-19 pandemic halted the last quarter of my senior year, I saw the sacrifices and struggles of all healthcare professionals. I also saw the importance of no-contact doctor visits. Seeing how I presented a version of this to my Capstone panel just a few weeks beforehand, I was intrigued to learn more about computer science and information systems. It took me two years in college to decide to part with medicine and study business.

When I decided to study business, I didn't consider majoring in MIS. My significant other encouraged me that it may be something that would interest me, and he was right. I'm taking this chance to expand my knowledge and form a lasting career in this field.
